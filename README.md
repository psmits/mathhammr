Mathhammr
=========


An R package full of useful functions for simulating dice rolling in [Warhammer 40k 8th edition](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Warhammer-40-000).

Entirely in development.

Mathhammer is the name used by the 40k community for analyzing the effectiveness of individual units. For a primer, I recommend this [DakkaDakka primer](https://www.dakkadakka.com/wiki/en/Basics_of_Mathhammer). Mathhammer is really just the application of probability and statistics to wargaming -- which is about as nerdy as it gets.
