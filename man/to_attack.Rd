\item{skill}{integer scalar minimum successful roll for relevant attack skill (e.g. BS 3+ would be skill = 3).}

\item{reroll}{integer scalar what MAXIMUM result rerolls (default NULL).}

\item{explode}{integer scalar what MINIMUM result explodes (default NULL).}

\item{expand}{named list of arguments for \code{\link{expand_dice}} (default NULL).}

# a single CSM attacks with Death to the False Emperor.
to_attack(n = 1, skill = 3, explode = 6)

# with expanding attacks
to_attack(n = 1, skill = 3, expand = list(lvl = 6, rate = 3))

# a single SM tactical attacks with an overcharged plasma
